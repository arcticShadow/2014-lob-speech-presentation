         p I had a very eventful start to my time at orion. But this is not a time for me to talk about myself!

        aside
          p By now I can safely assume everyone has noticed that Parliament/Common Web/UIE or what ever else you may have known them by, doesn’t exist as a team any more. The very talented patrons of Parliament are now assisting other product teams in our LOB, to help make them more awesome (Not that other teams weren't already awesome)
          p However before the dissolution of parliament the former MP’s were a very entertaining bunch to work with. I got to jump on board and work alongside some amazing characters, to name a few:

          p The silent but deadly developer is someone that you need to check has actually turned up to the office, someone that you never seem to see, but someone that consistantly exceeds expectations.

          p The Ninja.
          p You leave work for the day, worried that things are not progressing fast enough. Come back the next day and see that someone has committed half a dozen times during the night, and resolved all the issues that you had. Others in the team may look at the commits and attempt to make sense of what is happenning, but no one understands why a ninja does what they do.

          p The Underdog.
          p The underdog is constantly overlooked, and constantly suprises the team. Producing high quality output that stands the tests of time.

          li.substep Why were the teams labeled ‘portal’ tactical?
        aside
          p Looking back at the past few months since I joined the portal tactical team, It occurs to me, (BULLET) why were the teams labeled ‘portal’ tactical - everyone knew from the start that we would be spending at least some time on Results.

        aside
          p The next thing worth a mention is I never thought that it would be so difficult to get a bunch of people to choose a name for themselves. After much chasing many follups and far far to long, "Portal Tactical 1" and "Portal tactical 2" now have new team names. Just before a decision was reached, I told them that if they didnt choose from them selve, I would pick the worst animals I could think of and name them my self! The amusing part is that I gave them a list of examples and 'Carp' was one of them...
          p So, Among many great  contendeers there are a few honerable mentions.
